Create multiple Front End Post Forms for posts, pages and custom post types with complete custumizable form elements. 

== Description ==

Mage Front End Forms allows you to create a Front End post submission form for any post type. Each post form can have unique settings with fully customizable fields and design.

= Submit and Edit Posts from the Frontend =  
You can create multiple forms for users to submit and edit posts, pages or any custom post type from the front-end.

= Custom Taxonomy Dropdows and Taggable input fields =
Allow users to select categories, tags or any custom taxonomy. Selecting a category or custom taxonomy with child terms will automatically open a subcategory dropdown until a term is chosen that has no child terms. You can also include taggable input for post tag taxonomies or other multi-select fields.

= Frontend Featured Image and Attachment Uploads =
Upload a featured image or a whole gallery via the attachment upload feature, all easily managed from the frontend. Set a limit to how many attachments each post can have and what file types to allow. Users can manage, arrange, label and remove uploads directly form the front-end form.

= Complete Customizable Forms and Custom Meta Fields =
Choose what post fields you want users to submit. You can include infinite custom fields that save as custom post meta and set their requirements. The form builder allows complete custimization via the editor, letting you place input fields freely with any design.

= User Form Submission Settings =
You can restrict frontend posting to users with a minimum role, such as admins, editors, subscribers or even allow the public (non-members) to submit a form. Other settings allow you choose whether to submit a post in a pending or draft status, or to publish immediately; where to redirect users after submission; which email to notify upon submisson; and many other custom settings.
